# SCRABBLE

Group project during my bachelor studies at University of Mannheim.

Six students were tasked with creating a replication of the well-known board game [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble). Online functionalities as well as the ability to play against bots were some of the main requirements.

My contributions can be found under the username of "Thomas Andre Thielen". Additionally each class and method is signed by their respective authors; my handle reads "tthielen".
