# SCRABBLE

Group project during my bachelor studies at University of Mannheim.

Six students were tasked with creating a replication of the well-known board game [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble). Online functionalities as well as the ability to play against bots were some of the main requirements.

My contributions can be found under the username of "Thomas Andre Thielen".
